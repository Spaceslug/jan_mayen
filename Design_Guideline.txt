Jan Mayen exist as mod to give the player an opportunity to play Jan Mayen as 
a country. The experience should be very challenging, but not impossible. 
The options available to the player should be realistic, but can be very 
improbable. In addition the player have the option to turn Jan Mayen into a 
polar bear nation. The experience should then be fun and interesting, and it 
doesn't have to be balanced. Everything should have depth, in order to keep 
the player interested. Equivalent to a great nation.
